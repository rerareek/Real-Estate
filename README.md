# Real-Estate

This project is on predicting real estate prices using machine learning. Leveraging a structured approach, we analyzed and modeled the data with techniques to maximize prediction accuracy. 

### Project Overview:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Conducted thorough data summarization and visualization to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.

2. **Feature Transformation**:
   - Applied various transformation techniques, such as `VectorAssembler`, `OneHotEncoder`, and `PCA`, to prepare the data for modeling and enhance feature utility.

3. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Experimented with models including **Linear Regression** and others suited to regression tasks to predict real estate prices based on input features.

4. **Model Validation & Evaluation**:
   - Assessed model performance using multiple metrics like RÂ² and RMSE for regression, ensuring robust evaluation.
   - Implemented validation techniques, including train-test splits and cross-validation, to improve model reliability.

This project showcases a complete pipeline for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation, providing insights into machine learning applications for real estate price prediction.
